# Digit_recognition
## 📝 Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on the MNIST dataset to classify digits from 0 to 9..

## 🚀 Features

✅ Uses the MNIST dataset containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.✅ Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification.✅ Achieves high accuracy on test data (~98%).✅ Supports model evaluation and visualization.✅ Provides an interactive prediction interface.

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits..

## 🏗 Model Architecture

###The CNN model consists of:

🏞 Convolutional layers for feature extraction

📏 Max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction

🔗 Fully connected layers for classification

🔢 Softmax activation for output layer

## 🎯 Usage

🏋️ Train the model using train.py.

📈 Evaluate the model using evaluate.py.

🔍 Predict handwritten digits using predict.py.

📊 Visualize predictions with Matplotlib.

## 📊 Results

📌 The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test dataset.
