Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on the MNIST dataset to classify digits from 0 to 9.

Features

Uses the MNIST dataset containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification.

Achieves high accuracy on test data.

Supports model evaluation and visualization.

Provides an interactive prediction interface.

Dataset

The project uses the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.

Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of:

Convolutional layers for feature extraction

Max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction

Fully connected layers for classification

Softmax activation for output layer

Usage

Train the model using train.py.

Evaluate the model using evaluate.py.

Predict handwritten digits using predict.py.

Visualize predictions with Matplotlib.

Results

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test dataset.
